## Where to Use the Extension

### Supported Pages

  - The URL should look like: `https://[your-school].qoqolo.com/cos/o.x?c=/[hash]/folio`
- **Class Activity Page** - Navigate to the Class Activity page with posts visible

- **Recent Sign-in/out Page** - Navigate to the Recent Sign-in/out page
  - The URL should look like: `https://[your-school].qoqolo.com/cos/o.x?c=/[hash]/checkinout&func=recent`

## How to Use

The extension supports Portfolios, Class Activity, and Recent Sign-in/out pages. The usage is similar for all pages.

**Important**: It is recommended to scroll down the page first so that all activities (at least for the ones you wish to extract) are loaded. (This will be optimised in the future)

### Step 1: Navigate to the Page

1. Log in to your Qoqolo Student Portal
2. Navigate to the page:
   a. **Portfolios**: **Portfolios** → **Activity** → **Recent**
   b. **Class Activity**: **My Class** → Select your class of interest → **"All" tab**
   c. **Recent Sign-in/out**: Navigate to the Recent Sign-in/out page
3. Make sure you can see the list of activities/records that containing photos for usual cases.

#### Step 2-7: Use the Extension (see below)

### Step 2: Open the Extension

1. Click the Qoqolo Photo Downloader icon in Chrome's toolbar
2. The extension interface will open (either as a popup or side panel)

### Step 3: Set Date Range (Optional)

You can filter activities by date:

- **From**: Select a month and year to start crawling from (leave empty to start from the earliest displayed)
- **To**: Select a month and year to end crawling at (leave empty to go to the latest)

**Note:** The "Start Crawl" button will be disabled if "From" date is later than "To" date.

**Special behavior for Recent Sign-in/out:**
- Empty "From": Crawls backward chronologically until no data is found for 5 consecutive months
- Empty "To": Starts from the current month
- Months without data are not included in the results

### Step 4: Start Crawling

1. Click the **Start Crawl** button
2. The extension will automatically:
   - Extract information from each activity/month
   - Display items in real-time as they're processed
   - Show progress in the list
3. You can click **Stop** at any time to cancel the crawl
   - **Note for Recent Sign-in/out**: When you click Stop, the current month's photos will finish processing before stopping to avoid partial months

**Important:**

- Keep the page open and don't navigate away while crawling
- If your login session expires, you'll see an alert. Refresh the page and try again.

### Step 5: Review Extracted Items

As items are crawled, you'll see them listed with:

**For Portfolios and Class Activity:**
- Title
- Link to the original activity
- Images (with captions if available)
- Content/description
- Learning areas
- Teacher name
- Publish date
- Stickers

**For Recent Sign-in/out:**
- Month (year-month)
- Link to the month page
- Daily records table with:
  - Date
  - Drop-off and pick-up times (24-hour format)
  - Drop-off and pick-up persons
  - Comments
  - Check-in and check-out photo links
- Total images count

### Step 6: Copy or Export

For each item, you have two options:

- **Copy**: Copies the item's content as markdown text to your clipboard
  - A "Copied" message will briefly appear
- **Export**: Downloads the item as a ZIP file
  - **Portfolios/Class Activity**: Contains all images and a markdown file with the activity details
  - **Recent Sign-in/out**: Contains CSV (without photo URLs), JSON (with full data including photo links), and all images

### Step 7: Batch Download (All Items)

1. After crawling is complete, click the **Download** button in the action bar
2. The extension will:
   - Create a folder for each activity
   - Download all images with numbered prefixes (e.g., `01_image.jpg`)
   - Create a markdown file in each folder
   - Zip everything into one file
3. The batch ZIP filename will be:
   - Portfolios: `qoqolo-portfolio-yyyy_mm-yyyy_mm.zip`
   - Class Activity: `qoqolo-class-activity-yyyy_mm-yyyy_mm.zip`
   - Recent Sign-in/out: `qoqolo-check-in-out-yyyy_mm-yyyy_mm.zip`
   - The dates represent the earliest and latest activity/month dates in the batch

**Note:** The Download button is only available when:

- You have at least one crawled item
- You're not currently crawling

A progress bar will appear at the bottom of the action bar during batch download.

## Tips

- **Date Range**: Use the date pickers to limit crawling to specific months, which can save time
- **Session Expiry**: If crawling stops unexpectedly, check if your login session expired
- **Large Batches**: Batch downloads can take a while if you have many items with many images. Be patient!
- **Individual Exports**: You can export individual items while crawling is still in progress
- **Copy Feature**: Use the Copy button to quickly share activity content in markdown format
